            Rememeber the days of old when you'd join your 
            friends in the sandbox to play with cars, trucks, 
            shovels and dirt? We do too. Now thanks to social media 
            and overprotective parents, we all have social anxiety 
            and cannot for 5 minutes talk to someone new. 
            Here at SandBox, we take that trouble right out 
            of your hands. Based on your 5 favorite video games, 
            we auto-message 100 gamers that you're a new user and 
            a little about yourself. Then you can chat, befriend 
            and game together!
