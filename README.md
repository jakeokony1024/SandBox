##SandBox##
An application designed to streamline connection between video gamers based on similar interests and gaming styles. 

##Overview##
SandBox is here to help their users make connections with other gamers across the globe based on similar game 
interests and playing styles. We ask the client to create an account, provide us with their preferred gaming 
console, gamer tag and also have our users pick their top 5 favorite games, and based on those choices, we make 
the first step by reaching out to other users with those same favorited games. We send along the new users info 
and gamer tags, as well as their brief description and SandBox chat name so these users can build a relationship 
around gaming, using our always on Chat feature. 

Simply go to our [website](https://pure-earth-33980.herokuapp.com/), create an account, search for your favorite 
games and add them to your favorites list. More games can be added, but please put your top 5 favorite games to 
help us find the best connections for you.

You can view the authors of this site [here](https://github.com/jakeokony1024/SandBox/graphs/contributors)

* A static dashboard page that users can search for games on and save them to a list 
* Create an account and store information in a mongoDb, and then get that information and display it on the static page. 

What we are still working on: 

* User authentication and login: We started using Firebase login and authentication, but ran into complications using MongoDb as well  
* Chat features/ capabilites: Once login and auth is set up, we can enable the chat features for every user. 
* Profile dashboard: Once login is set up, we can display the correct info on the users dashboard
